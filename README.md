# New App

New App is an AI-powered video generation tool that transforms scripts into engaging videos, movies, TV shows, and web series. It enables users to create short clips from long videos, add realistic avatars, sound, captions, and even scan scripts directly using their phone camera. The app is powered by advanced AI tools, including an AI assistant akin to Jarvis from Iron Man, that helps with creative decisions and tool upgrades over time.
